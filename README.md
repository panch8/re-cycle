# `re-cycle`

This is Re-Cycle, a project born in the #OIS24

Cycles are still an underappreciated asset. We all have significant reasons to test tools that assist us with their management tasks. It is worth mentioning that there are several fascinating projects currently underway that have inspired these ideas.

We believe in a stack-on-each-other's structure where we all contribute, ultimately benefiting a larger, shared space. However, it is essential to refine this concept, particularly in terms of feasibility and roadmap development.

This repo provides a Front-End representation of the "Swagger API" to demonstrate the proof of concept feature. This includes providing a "manual" alpha version of the possibilities, with a copy-and-paste command solution for the terminal. The goal is to create a handy interface that will help gather community feedback.
